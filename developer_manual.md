# Introduction

This a scientific calculator written in C language which evaluates the expressions given in a file supporting standard mathematical operations and a set of functions. 
In our project we are developing a Scientific calculator which evaluate all lines of expressions from an input file that involves arithmetic operations and scientific functions and will return the output in the same file. Since the calculator evaluates all the expressions present in the file in a single execution, user saves lot of time. This calculator comes up with a different way of taking inputs and providing outputs to the user.

# Requirements

The client gives expressions as inputs using “Files”. The file given by the client is read, analyzed, evaluated and the results are given back in the same file. The client requirements are as follows:
1.The system should perform arithmetic operations such as Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulus, Exponent.
2.The system should perform basic math function such as Absolute value, Square root, Cube root, Log value.
3.The system should perform trigonometric functions such as Sine, Cosine, Tangent , Arcsine, Arccos and Arctan.
4.The system should perform statistical function such as Average, Mean, Median, Variance, Minimum value, and maximum value.
5.The system should perform other function such as floor , ceil, e^x and summation.
6.The system should be able to read a complex expression which includes many operations and functions.
7.The system should follow the order of operations -BODMAS while evaluating the expression.
8.The system should be able to take a file as input.
9.The system should be able to read all the expressions given in the file ( given by the user as input).
10.The system should write the evaluated output to the same file which was given as input.
