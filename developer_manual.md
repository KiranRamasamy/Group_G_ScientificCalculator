# Introduction

This a scientific calculator written in C language which evaluates the expressions given in a file supporting standard mathematical operations and a set of functions. 
In our project we are developing a Scientific calculator which evaluate all lines of expressions from an input file that involves arithmetic operations and scientific functions and will return the output in the same file. Since the calculator evaluates all the expressions present in the file in a single execution, user saves lot of time. This calculator comes up with a different way of taking inputs and providing outputs to the user.
