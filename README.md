# Group_G_ScientificCalculator
Objective:
The purpose of the calculator is to evaluate all lines of expressions from an input file that involves arithmetic operations and scientific functions and will return the output in the same file. Since the calculator evaluates all the expressions present in the file in a single execution, user saves lot of time. This calculator comes up with a different way of taking inputs and providing outputs to the user.
The user gives expressions as inputs using “Files”. The expression in the file can be entered in the standard infix syntax, with the parantheses denoting non-standard order of operations. The file given by the user is read, analyzed, evaluated and the results are given back in the same file.
User needs the calculator to perform below operations and functions.
The different operations are as follows:
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Modulus
6. Exponent.

The functions are as follows:
1. Absolute Value
2. Sine
3. Cosine
4. Tangent
5. Logarithm
6. Exponent
7. Average
8. Mean
9. Median
10. Variance
11. Square root
12. Cube root
13. Minimum value
14. Maximum value
15. Permutation
16. Combination
17. Floor
18. Ceiling
19. Arcsine
20. Arccosine
21. Arctangent
22. Summation
